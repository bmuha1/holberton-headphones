# 0x09. Implement a design from scratch

---

## Learning Objectives:bulb:

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.

### [0. Read and be familiar with Figma](./README.md)

- Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

If you can’t access to it, please find here the Figma file

Important notes with Figma:

- if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- some values are in float - feel free to round them
  For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: #FF6565
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

### [1. Header](./0-index.html)

- Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling
use variables
simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

### [2. "What we do..." section](./1-index.html)

- Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

### [3. "Our results" section](./2-index.html)

- Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

### [4. Contact us ](./3-index.html)

- Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

### [5. Footer](./4-index.html)

- Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!

And you are done!

Good job!

### [6. Replace image by... code! ](./100-index.html)

- In the section “Our results”, replace item background image by HTML and CSS only!

### [7. Let's animate items ](./101-index.html)

- From 4-index.html and 4-styles.css, add fun animations to “What we do…” and “Our results” sections items row. Either all the time, either when hover.

Scaling, opacity, rotation, bouncing… many options!

### [8. And SASS?? ](./102-styles.scss)

- Take your 101-styles.css file and create a 102-styles.scss that will be the SASS version of it.

\$ sass 102-styles.scss > 101-styles.css
